## Planning session on Slack 03/03/2018

I hope this works….

### Olga [12:01 PM]
:+1:

### Lorna N [12:02 PM]
I’m going to grab some lunch.  Are we supposed to start discussing stuff now, or once we’re all back at 1.30?

### David R [12:04 PM]
We’re to have things discussed by 1.30, but lunch time first.

### Olga [12:08 PM]
yep going to eat now

### Lorna N [12:15 PM]
OK.

### Olga [12:57 PM]
my message I sent to the instructors was this, not necessarily a question “I’m getting confused as the project structure keeps changing every day. I day we used controllers, another day models and then we don’t use them e.g. for the mongoquotes homework.  That was my reference project for the lab so it’s hard to follow what structure to use and where to put stuff. I find it hard enough to understand what to put in server.js, app.js etc and then change where to to place the code the next time.

e.g.
The mongoquotes homework had a SERVICES directory within SRC with a request.js but this solution doesn’t and  it’s using a CONTROLLERS directory at a higher level + a MODELs directory within SRC”
I would like a diagram to explain all the links and a checklist of best order of how to build up the files incrementally and test

### Lorna N [1:05 PM]
I think what would have helped me would have been to build on the *same* example each day, with extensions.  So use countries for all of them…  What do you think?


### Lorna N [1:09 PM]
Unless it is to be sure that we understand what is where, and why, and what it is supposed to be doing…


### Lorna N [1:10 PM]
I know.  It is frustrating feeling that we have to work something out when there is potentially a better way out there.

### Lorna N [1:17 PM]
I’m still on the trail of that bug…

### Lorna N [1:27 PM]
@davidrawson are you about?

### David R [1:28 PM]
Yes, just back from clearing a path.
Trying to formulate concise questions but
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

### Lorna N [1:32 PM]
Sympathies.

### Max [1:38 PM]
Hi all, just back from digging my sis out of a snowdrift o.O
Silly thing tried to drive into work with her little honda jazz

### Olga [1:38 PM]
oh dear !

### Max [1:39 PM]
I’m a little lost as to the groups, was it just a discussion of the project from yesterday?


### Lorna N [1:41 PM]
oepsie! I’m going to be popping in and out this afternoon as I’m single-parenting.

### Max [1:41 PM]
ah, well i can certainly say that I didn’t have a great working replica of what was intended. Mostly a nightmare getting all the terminal commands correct etc…

### Lorna N [2:15 PM]
sorry, I missed a chunk of that. I’ve downloaded the briefs.
I’m not always going to be able to be at my computer, so if i don’t respond to a slack message to join the instructors please could someone text me: 07907366187?

### Olga [2:17 PM]
ok

### Max [2:18 PM]
Might it be worth setting up our own Google hangouts, or will slack work for the time being?

### Olga [2:19 PM]
guess could set one up..don’t know how though
I’m going to start reading through briefs now and write some notes

### David R [2:20 PM]
I think setting up a hangout requires a G-Suite account. A free 14 day trial is available - I’ll look into it.

### Lorna N [2:20 PM]
Thanks David.

### Max [2:21 PM]
Oki doke, I’ve got some more instinctive choices but a wee while to look would be good

### Olga [2:32 PM]
getting bit wild out there !!

### Lorna N [2:41 PM]
Yup.  Sorry - off feeding the offspring.
So, team, what do you all want to get out of this project?

### Max [2:42 PM]
Bruntsfield looks like a ski resort!
Well i feel like the flightr app would  be a great lark, plus there’s a free API from skyscanner that we could use

### Olga [2:43 PM]
to have a better understanding of how a javascript web app all comes together and be more confident in explaining it to someone

### Lorna N [2:43 PM]
And in terms of more broadly, @Max - consolidation / new toys / something else?
@Olga: concise and to the point!

### Olga [2:45 PM]
I was confused by the flightr brief as wasn’t sure what data we would use

### David R [2:45 PM]
I would like to work with some interesting APIs to build something *useful*. Consolidation, and I suppose improving those areas where I’m lacking…ahem ,CSS.

### Olga [2:45 PM]
my 1st preference was the educational app

### Max [2:45 PM]
I’d also like to show a good planning regime, as it would be good to show to potential employers

### Lorna N [2:46 PM]
@Max - the skyscanner API do you have a link to it please?
@Olga what sort of app did you have in mind?
@davidrawson do you have a definition of “useful”?

### Olga [2:47 PM]
also get the hang of git control /master/branches

### Lorna N [2:47 PM]
I can help with git.
@Olga I think you have experience with planning, and @davidrawson too?

### Max [2:48 PM]

### David R [2:48 PM]
I’ll post my notes, hold on

### Olga [2:49 PM]
not a specific sort of app.. - Maybe if write down things we enjoy/like /passionate like and see if we can come up with a common interest ?
- Me - enjoy travel worldwide/ walking/salsa & ceilidh dancing,  speaking Spanish, getting out in the fresh air
- Or perhaps something that’s very topical/trending at the moment on twitter ? Education on waste recycling/removing plastics from products ?

### David R [2:49 PM]
SharesApp.
We’ve seen it done well with graphs, charts, news and shares APIs. We could do it just as well.
I could find it interesting, but I’m not immediately drawn to it.


Flightr
My first thought is an aside - an app to model demand for taxis at airports, an arrivals api…eh, no daft thought.

Flightr - but for trains - Trainr!
Filghtr - but for bikes - Cycler! Nah.


Sports Dashboard
What is sports?
Least favourite, on first impressions.


Educational App.
This needs a good idea, great styling, excellent UX. I have none of those things…yet. I would love to do it but without that good idea I think it would be tricky.

Store Finder
Very good for consolidation. Could be made interesting.


Browser Game
Any ideas? I don’t.

### Lorna N [2:49 PM]
OK @Max - I see they offer widgets as a free option, but I can’t see how we would use that to make our own website.

### Max [2:51 PM]
@Lorna N oops, thought it provided flight timetable data as well. I’ll do some more digging

### Lorna N [2:53 PM]
My thoughts:
SharesApp: could be very nicely done, but I’m not excited by the idea.
Flightr: I’m concerned about where we’d get the data from, but otherwise it could be an interesting combination of map and graph displays
Sports: meh, unless you count politics as a sport and we did a brexit-watch app…
Store Finder: most similar to what we’ve done, and would allow us to get really comfortable with maps.
Browser Game: Eek.  Not a clue.
Education App: could be an extension of our maps and charts knowledge as well, if we wanted say a “click on country x” quiz, or “show me a country where they speak language y”

### Max [2:53 PM]
I agree with the browser game, the blackjack app was hard enough ^^

### Olga [2:54 PM]
yep don’t fancy shares, sports or browser game

### Max [2:55 PM]
I like the idea for the country educational app +1
https://aviation-edge.com/
Aviation database and API
Aviation Edge - Aviation database and API
IATA API and ICAO API with Flight tracker API, air routes, airline and airport timetables API, IATA codes and ICAO codes of IATA database and ICAO database made for developers

### David R [2:56 PM]
I don’t know about flight info but we can get json train info - https://huxley.unop.uk/

### Max [2:57 PM]
They have a free option, or a $5 subcription per month. But i think as we won’t be using more than 1000 calls to the api during the project we could get away with the free one

### Lorna N [3:00 PM]
OK, so it sounds like we’re tending towards education or flight+hotel price comparisons of the options we’ve been given.

@davidrawson I don’t know enough to be sure if a SOAP api is something we could use?

@Max that gives us timetables for flights etc.  Are we talking about something like the laterooms setup for hotel booking plus a flight plug-in with prices.  I’m not really clear on how that project would work.
Or, obviously train+hotel options.
I do remember that HighCharts had a map options which looked really impressive and could highlight a particular area of a map…

### Max [3:04 PM]
Late-rooms would be a good example, but i was more thinking along the lines of the easy-jet website that has the option to book a hotel at your set destination. Maybe even providing contact details for local taxi services etc?
So we would have to implement pricing of flights etc…

### Lorna N [3:04 PM]
Bit of googling about SOAP: it looks like there is a way to wrap up a SOAP api so it behaves like a RESTful api:
https://strongloop.com/strongblog/soap-into-rest-apis-with-loopback-node-js/
http://loopback.io/getting-started/

### David R [3:05 PM]
@Lorna N Huxley is a json proxy - we dont have to use SOAP

### Lorna N [3:05 PM]
Ah, that’s a relief! @davidrawson
Trains has the advantage of limiting us to the UK, and so naturally limiting the size of the project.

Education app gives us a lot more scope to come up with our own ideas.

Is anyone feeling more strongly about one or the other?
Sorry @davidrawson I just saw SOAP and freaked a bit.  Should have read down the page.

### Max [3:07 PM]
Would lean towards the train booking app over the educational…. but they both sound really cool.
I’d say the educational app is more front end heavy, which suits me down to the ground.

### David R [3:08 PM]
I’m just glad we’re not doing sports!

### Max [3:08 PM]
it’s sophies chioce for me  =^^

### Olga [3:09 PM]
what would the train booking app do ?

### Max [3:10 PM]
My instincs say that we would set up a booking database that correlates to the json timetables…. prices are up to us i guess
Maybe even have some links to local hotels and travel. much like e17 linked articles to their stock apps

### Lorna N [3:12 PM]
Hmm.  MVP for the booking app seems to suggest that we would show travel times, destinations and prices, along with hotels at the various destinations and their prices?

### Max [3:13 PM]
Aye, then the bookings would be an extension.

### Olga [3:14 PM]
yes it’s says its a comparison app not a booking app

### David R [3:14 PM]
Google maps have a transit layer that could be incorporated - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/trafficlayer#traffic_layer

https://developers.google.com/_static/9abbcf9aa7/images/share/devsite-google-blue.png

### Olga [3:15 PM]
I can’t really see the benefit if the person can’t think book the train/hotel when they decide the one they like ?
or am i miss understanding this ?

### Lorna N [3:15 PM]
OK.  Also, both TripAdvisor and Expedia seem to offer apis

### Max [3:18 PM]
@Olga I’m not sure i understand the question; do you mean that it should have the booking implementation? Because as I see it we would simply provide comparisons, much like moneysupermarket does for car insurance etc
Also, love the idea of requesting an uber from the app

### Lorna N [3:20 PM]
Soooo.  It sounds like we’re heading for some sort of travel comparison site?

### Olga [3:20 PM]
but don’t comparison sites usually provide a link to then buy the product/service ?

### Lorna N [3:20 PM]
@Olga some do and some don’t.

### Max [3:22 PM]
It may be one too many an arm or leg to provide the booking link. Maybe should be something to ask the tutors in our meet :memo:
However, I think the country educational app should get a bit of consideration as well. Something as simple as choosing the Country/City/State prompted in a canvas would be quite fun i reckon.

### Lorna N [3:24 PM]
Agreed, @Max I think the booking app would be a lot more challenging to integrate the various APIs etc than a map-based education app in terms of MVP.
@davidrawson do you have any thoughts?

### David R [3:27 PM]
Yep, the possibilities of the EduApp needs exploring. It needs something besides just countries - history, culture?

### Lorna N [3:27 PM]
languages, sports (ducks), wildlife?
@Olga ?

### Olga [3:28 PM]
my head is hurting .. working remotely is more tiring as don’t feel lift the laptop all day !

### Max [3:28 PM]
@davidrawson maybe use the sprigs for some market research? :laughing:
``*sprogs``

Olga [3:30 PM]
maybe some travels phrases for the country you choose
Donde esta la estacion ?

### Max [3:31 PM]
Our best la biblioteche?

### Lorna N [3:31 PM]
What are everyone’s thoughts on a question-and-answer setup vs. an explorer setup? Would we be able to offer both?
Local cuisine / recipes to try?
There are a few recipe apis, I think.

### David R [3:34 PM]
Currently looking at art history APIs

### Max [3:34 PM]
That would be a great addition, we should have a trello board/ moscow set up

### Olga [3:35 PM]
i guess doing agile.. start with bare minimum and increment in small sprints if time alllows

### Lorna N [3:35 PM]
Could you set one up, @Max?

### Max [3:35 PM]
But first, a quick vote. All those in favour of the Education app ?
All those for the travel app?

### David R [3:36 PM]
Indecisive me.

### Max [3:36 PM]
p.s. ill get on to the trello board

### David R [3:37 PM]
NB Google Meetings requires the 14 day trial.  Google hangouts can be set up immediately.

### Lorna N [3:38 PM]
If our exploration of the education app turns into a mudbath, we can always think again as long as it’s before Monday?
BRB. Off to provide towels and hot-chocolate to a snow monster.

### David R [3:38 PM]
5 min kettle break!

### Max [3:38 PM]
seconded

### Olga [3:39 PM]
yep need a break :slightly_smiling_face:
it would be really good if we could meetup in person tomorrow but guess see how the weather is

### Max [3:39 PM]
:timer_clock: Let’s reconvene in 10 mins

### Lorna N [3:49 PM]
The snow-monster and neighbours have decided that the thing to do is to get the washing-up bowl full of snow, lug it upstairs, and throw snowballs down from a wide-open window. :snowflake: Bit chilly in here for some reason…
Schools are off tomorrow as well, as @davidrawson will know.  I really must put in some more development time on that cloning device, or start on a time-traveller instead.

### Olga [3:55 PM]
Matt from E17 sent me this via slack yesterday

### Lorna N [3:56 PM]
?

### Olga [3:56 PM]
uploaded this image: git steps.jpeg


### Olga [3:57 PM]
with this message “make someone the git master, don’t deviate from these steps. we found it best to have one person in the group take responsibility for committing the project to master, as well as be the liaison for adding any features to the development branch. there will definitely be a few conflicts along the way, so its better to have two people go through each merge conflict and select the right bits of code”

### Max [3:57 PM]
@Lorna N That’s annoyingly adorable

### Lorna N [3:58 PM]
@Olga that sounds very useful.  I especially like the idea of two people looking at every conflict.

### Olga [3:58 PM]
it might still be worth rotating the role so we all get practice at this but see how it goes

I’m not sure how much longer I have got before things get totally out of hand here…

### Olga [4:13 PM]
is there a way on trello to create equiv of post-it notes and then assign to must/should/could later ?

### Lorna N [4:13 PM]
@Olga - pop over to the main e18 and join us?

### Lorna N [4:30 PM]
I’ve copied all of this into a markdown file so we’ve got it for reference.

### Max [4:39 PM]
@Olga they can me moved from column to column, so best just add any ideas to the could segment and then we can decide where they go later
One thing that i did realise is that if we were do do an interactive WORLD map we would be pretty limited to the kind of other data we could display about each. perhaps this should just be a map of Scotland?

### Olga [4:41 PM]
ok we also need a general planning list that’s not specific to the project functionality/mvp

### Lorna N [4:46 PM]
Sorry - snow clearup from carpets ongoing here…

### Max [4:47 PM]
As to the general communication I feel a standup at 9am would be ideal, virtual or otherwise.

### Lorna N [4:47 PM]
OK.  How do you all feel about some solo brainstorming tonight, add to the trello board, and then talk about it tomorrow?

### David R [4:47 PM]
From the brief, this is supposed to showcase features, so maybe art history of Italy, cuisine of Thailand,  wildlife of Croatia all dependant on the apis we decide to use. And, yes, standup however we can.

### Max [4:47 PM]
Where’s everyone living just now?
@Lorna N I like that idea

### Lorna N [4:48 PM]
tollcross.

### Olga [4:48 PM]
top of leith walk/elm row

### David R [4:49 PM]
Nr top of Leith Walk - Bellevue

### Max [4:50 PM]
Well that’s not too bad. I could set up a carpool to bring us into college tomorrow if buses still aren’t running?

### Lorna N [4:50 PM]
I’m going to be a bit restricted in what I can do tomorrow unless I can call in some favours.  There’s a possibility I can take Frances to a friend, but I won’t know until tomorrow…  I’ll walk.

### David R [4:50 PM]
If it is open I can walk.

### Olga [4:52 PM]
where are you ### Max ?

### Max [4:52 PM]
Oki doke, we’ll play it by ear. I know that it’s definitely better to be meeting in person at the moment so perhaps a bit more personal prep and brainstorming would be beneficial tonight.
im in bruntsfield, but i’ve got my dad’s swanky new landrover to act as our personal uber
…. mainly looking for an excuse to drive it really ```^_^```

### Olga [4:53 PM]
yep sounds good to me
ha ha

### Max [4:55 PM]
Good, settles it. Maybe we want to pick some topics? Dave if you can keep looking at how we can implement some historical facts?
I’ll keep looking at the maps implementation
@Olga What do you fancy focusing on?
p.s. any ideas we may have can be added ad infinitem to the trello board

### Olga [4:56 PM]
I’ll look at some of the language.. will try see if there’s any apis that translate words

### Lorna N [4:57 PM]
If it’s OK, I’m just going to do a random brain dump of anything that comes to mind once I’ve done a bit of kid wrangling.  Maybe read up a little on scrum / agile to see how things can be organised?

### Max [4:58 PM]
good idea. Just before we ‘break up’ for the evening; are we happy with the idea that it should be about the cities of scotland/other main attractions eg. aviemore, loch lomond, etc?

### Lorna N [4:58 PM]
Can we leave that until tomorrow @Max
Just in case this evening’s brainstorming comes up with more good ideas?

### Max [4:59 PM]
sure thing :+1:

### Lorna N [5:00 PM]
So, tomorrow is Friday.  Are we still aiming for 9am?

### Max [5:00 PM]
Good point…. how about 10?
Going offline to try and loot some food from sainsbury’s. Whish me luck!

### Lorna N [5:01 PM]
luck

### davidrawson [5:02 PM]
Whatever time is fine by me. I’ll, hopefully, have 3 good educational apis to show by then.

### Lorna N [5:06 PM]
Excellent!
